    <p id="quote"> "I grew up on the land, on a small farm in NE Iowa. Life was not always easy. I 
    experienced the economic depressions of the 1930s, and from the experience, I 
    felt that families on the land needed help from scientists, and I dedicated my life 
    to science, and especially to food production."</p>
